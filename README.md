# John Dews' ACME Financial



The api and the client are separated; however the /api runtime will serve the client up at localhost:3000/
This app uses angular 1.x.x for the client side and express for the api, and conforms to run on node.js v0.10 =<

I hade to modify the ```users.json``` file a tiny bit by adding a name for the array of users so that lowdb could pick it up.


How to Run:

With node & npm installed within the /api directory run ```npm install && npm start```






# Simple Developer Exercise

The savvy cats over at ACME Financial would like to be able to allow users to login to their account, check their balance and update their personal details. Write a simple web application (API and UI) using node.js and lowdb that lets users accomplish those tasks.

Feel free to use any other libraries or tool chains as long as the core code is javascript and node.js. npm (https://www.npmjs.org) is your friend - no need to recreate the wheel.

You will find the base data file in ```/data```
